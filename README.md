# code-quiz

## Purpose

A website in which users take a timed mulitple choice quiz, to test their knowledge in javascript fundamentals.

The application is purely HTML, CSS and Javascript. They layout should have the start up page with info on the quiz as well as a timer on the top right hand corner and a link to view all the high scores on the top left hand corner of the page.

When start quiz is pushed we begin the quiz and the start up info is hidden where as then the quiz question is shown. Each question will have 4 possible answers with 5 questions prompted.

IF the user picks the incorrect answer they will lose time off the quiz and have to proceed on to the next question.

Once the quiz is complete the user will then be able to submit their score. We will then have record of all the highscores from previous quizes as well as names on record. The user will also have the option to clear from all past scores.
